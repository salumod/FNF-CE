Don’t look complacent
wearin’ those rags
you ain't adjacent
Lookie I'm fly and you look basic
Look in her eyes and 
I feel like taking it
for the win
her dad be evil no twin
Skin purp like the sprite sippin’
He open his yap and 
you wouldn’t believe
but the sound of 
an angel when he spittin’
Even though he look like a demon
hold my blue nuts as I battle for the taking
of this girl
I just wanna hold her hand
look in our DMs and 
it’s like candy land
Yo
I really can't bust when her evil a** dad
tryna make my a** be grass
So I got one shot,
learned to spit real hot
and it might just go like this
I don’t mean no disrespect
but there’s something about her I can't let go
Baby you know that I love you
even though my balls are blue
I want to spend my life with her
even if her dad is evil or some sh**
Now spit it like this:
We getting freaky 
on a Friday night
yeah
I just want to hold her tight, yeah
Her hair her eyes
her thighs 
yeah
If I die 
it'll all be worth it
just to get a chance 
to show she’s worth it
I just want to hold her tight,
yeah
Her hair her eyes
her thighs
yeah
If I die
it'll all be worth it
just to get a chance
to show she’s worth it
